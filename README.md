# Project overview

This project aims to analyze OCD patients' data to answer different questions about Obsessive-compulsive disorder using different tools.

## Current Project idea summary and main challenges

Studying the  Comorbid Anxiety and Depression in OCD patients, and I aim to use simple EDA as well as ML to predict comorbidity. Currently thinking about a way to train a model with only 80 data points,  and if there is a way to clean the data in another way, so I can get a larger sample (more patients) out of it. (Other aspects might be added to the project)

## Main research question

How do early-life stress and coping style, as well as OCD severity influence the presence of co-occurring mental disorders in individuals with OCD in adults?

The co-occurring mental problems in this research are only anxiety and depression

## Project objectives and main points

**one**: classify people to:

* probable clinical anxiety/ depression (High HADS-D/HADS-A scores)(severe/moderate severity)
* possible(breadline case) anxiety/depression (medium HADS-D/HADS-A scores) (mild severity)
* No anxiety/ Depression (low HADS-D/HADS-A scores)

**Two**: study the differences and correlations between the above categories and other problems like childhood trauma and coping style, as well as OCD severity and other symptom dimensions.

**Three**: build an ML model to predict the above classes based on things like CATS score (Child abuse and trauma scale), Coping style using the brief COPE scale as well as ocd severity and type.

Correlations between features and co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression, None) are also going to be studied to inspect if they affect the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

_The [OCD-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data) that will be used is fictional OCD patients' data from kaggle that hopefully is a good substitute for real patients' data (other datasets might be used)_

## Other research questions

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

**NOTE**: adjustments could be made as the project is evolving

### Personal learning goals

* Reinforce data science knowledge.

* Apply machine learning
