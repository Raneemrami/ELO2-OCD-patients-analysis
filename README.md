# Project overview

This project aims to analyze OCD patients' data to answer different questions about Obsessive-compulsive disorder using different tools.

## Main research question

How do demographics such as age, gender, and other clinical factors, such as OCD severity, influence the presence of co-occurring mental disorders in individuals with OCD in adults?

The co-occurring mental problems in this research are only anxiety and depression

The goal is to conduct two main steps:

1. Study the correlation between OCD severity level and the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

2. Use machine learning to predict whether the patient is gonna have.

* 0: no anxiety or depression

* 1: anxiety and no depression

* 2: depression and no anxiety

using demographic features like age, gender, education level, and Marital status, as well as clinical data like past mental problems diagnosis, and OCD severity level.

Correlations between features (demographic and clinical) and co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression, None) are also going to be studied to inspect if they affect the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

_The [OCD-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data) that will be used is fictional OCD patients' data from kaggle that hopefully is a good substitute for real patients' data (other datasets might be used)_

## Other research questions

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

## objectives

* Measure the correlation between OCD severity level and co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression).

* Use machine learning to predict co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression, nothing) using features like age, education level, OCD severity, family ocd history, previous diagnosis, marital status

* Conduct EDA to answer sub-questions related to OCD patients (to get answers that  are supported by the data)

**NOTE**: adjustments could be made as the project is evolving

### Personal learning goals

* Reinforce data science knowledge.

* Apply machine learning
