# Project overview

This project aims to analyze OCD patients' data to answer different questions about Obsessive-compulsive disorder using different tools.

## Current Project idea summary and main challenges

Studying the  Comorbid Anxiety and Depression in OCD patients, and I aim to use simple EDA as well as ML to predict comorbidity. Currently thinking about a way to train a model with only 80 data points,  and if there is a way to clean the data in another way, so I can get a larger sample (more patients) out of it. (Other aspects might be added to the project)

## Main research question

How do early-life stress and coping style, influence the presence of co-occurring mental disorders in individuals with OCD in adults?

The co-occurring mental problems in this research are only anxiety and depression

The goal is to conduct two main steps:

1. Classify participants into groups (OCD-only, OCD+anxiety, OCD+depression, OCD+both).

2. Test whether **OCD severity or symptom dimensions** differ between these groups.

3. Use machine learning to predict whether the patient is gonna have.

* 0: no anxiety or depression

* 1: anxiety and no depression

* 2: depression and no anxiety

* 3: Both anxiety and depression

Correlations between features and co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression, None) are also going to be studied to inspect if they affect the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

_The [OCD-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data) that will be used is fictional OCD patients' data from kaggle that hopefully is a good substitute for real patients' data (other datasets might be used)_

## Other research questions

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

**NOTE**: adjustments could be made as the project is evolving

### Personal learning goals

* Reinforce data science knowledge.

* Apply machine learning
