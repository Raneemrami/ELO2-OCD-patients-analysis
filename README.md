# Project overview

this project amis to analyze OCD patients data to answer different questions about Obsessive-compulsions-disorder using different tools.

## Main research question

How do demographics such as age, gender, and other clinical factors, such as OCD severity, influence the presence of co-occurring mental disorders in individuals with OCD in adults?

co-occurring mental problems in this research are only anxiety and depression

the goal is to conduct two main steps:

1. study the correlation between OCD severity level and the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

2. use machine learning to predict weather patient is gonna have.

* 0: no anxiety or depression

* 1: anxiety and no depression

* 2: depression and no anxiety

using demographic features like age, gender, education level amd Martial status as well as clinical data like past mental problems diagnosis, and OCD severity level.

correlations between features (demographic and clinical) and co-occurring mental problems (anxiety, depression, nothing) is also going to be studied to inspect if it has an affect on the presence of anxiety and/or depression.

_the [OCD-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data) that will be used is fictional OCD patients data from kaggle that hopefully is a good synthetic data of real patients_

## Other research questions

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of compulsion tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with anxiety compared to other types in OCD patients?

Do certain types of obsessions tend to occur more with depression compared to other types in OCD patients?

## objectives

* Measure the correlation between OCD severity level and co-occurring metal problems (anxiety, depression).

* Use machine learning to predict co-occurring metal problems (anxiety, depression, nothing) using features like age, education level, OCD severity, family ocd history, previous diagnosis, martial status

* Conduct EDA to answer sub-questions related to OCD patients, (to get answers that  are supported by the data)

Objectives might be adjusted throughout the project while maintaining the main goal.

### Personal learning goals

* Re-enforce data science knowledge.

* Apply machine learning
